    "  \"response_to_input_task\": \"Executive Summary:\\nThe applicant displays significant risk indicators in the composite risk analysis. Although the monthly income is consistent, the applicant presents a very low savings-to-expense ratio (approximately 3.4%), unstable employment (current role under 3 years), and poor credit behavior as evidenced by repeated missed on-time payments. The spending behavior shows discretionary and gambling-related transactions, and customer engagement feedback is negative. Moreover, family responsibilities with three dependents introduce additional financial stress, and recent bankruptcy trends in upcoming years add further concern. \\n\\nDetailed Analysis and Calculations:\\n1. Savings-to-Expense Ratio Calculation:\\n   - Total Savings Deposits over 6 months: $200 + $150 + $100 + $50 + $100 + $150 = $750\\n   - Average Savings Deposits: $750 / 6 = $125\\n   - Total Recurring Expenses over 6 months: $3,500 + $3,600 + $3,700 + $3,800 + $3,750 + $3,850 = $22,200\\n   - Average Recurring Expenses: $22,200 / 6 ≈ $3,700\\n   - Savings-to-Expense Ratio: 125 / 3700 ≈ 3.4%\\n   - According to the scoring rules, a ratio below 30% results in a low score; thus, a score of approximately 40 is applied for Savings Behavior.\\n\\n2. Employment Stability:\\n   - The applicant’s current tenure as a Freelance Consultant is 2.3 years (<3 years threshold), which results in a low score. A score of 45 is assigned for Employment Stability.\\n\\n3. Credit Behavior:\\n   - Loan Repayment History (Dataset 5) shows that all payments were not on time and have resulted in defaults.\\n   - Credit Card Payment Data (Dataset 6) indicates all months as 'No' for on-time payments.\\n   - Consequently, a low score of around 40 is given for Credit Behavior.\\n\\n4. Income Consistency:\\n   - Dataset 1 shows stable monthly income around $3200 with minimal variation. This consistency merits a high score; a score of 90 is assigned.\\n\\n5. Financial Discipline and Customer Engagement:\\n   - Financial Discipline is moderate due to discretionary spending and gambling-related expenses observed in Dataset 4, resulting in a score of 50.\\n   - Customer Engagement is low, based on negative feedback in Dataset 7, which justifies a score of 40.\\n\\n6. Family Details Impact:\\n   - The additional financial burdens reflected by three dependents and high monthly expenditures for schooling and healthcare (Dataset 8) further increase the overall risk, warranting a downward adjustment of the final composite score.\\n\\nComposite Risk Score Calculation (using the Advanced Composite Risk Score Matrix):\\n   • Savings Behavior (25% weight): 0.25 × 40 = 10\\n   • Credit Behavior (25% weight): 0.25 × 40 = 10\\n   • Employment Stability (15% weight): 0.15 × 45 = 6.75\\n   • Income Consistency (15% weight): 0.15 × 90 = 13.5\\n   • Financial Discipline (10% weight): 0.10 × 50 = 5\\n   • Engagement and Feedback (10% weight): 0.10 × 40 = 4\\n   Total = 10 + 10 + 6.75 + 13.5 + 5 + 4 = 49.25\\n\\nAdjustment Factors:\\n   • Family Details: The presence of three dependents and high non-discretionary family expenditures reduce financial flexibility, prompting a further downward adjustment of approximately 4-5 points.\\n   • Bankruptcy Data: Indications of potential bankruptcies in upcoming years (2024 and 2025) add further risk. \\n\\nFinal Adjusted Composite Risk Score ≈ 45 (rounded).\\n\\nRecommendation:\\nBased on the composite risk score of approximately 45, the applicant falls into a high-risk category. Therefore, it is recommended that the applicant be offered conditional credit with additional terms. Such terms should include stricter monitoring, possible collateral requirements, and perhaps a review period to ensure improved financial discipline and stability. This approach balances the opportunity for credit access while mitigating potential risks due to financial instability and future adverse indicators.\",\n",
    "  \"justification\": \"Every component of the analysis was derived by examining the relevant datasets provided. The very low savings-to-expense ratio, unstable employment, and poor credit behavior critically lowered the scores in those categories. While income consistency was a redeeming factor, it was offset by negative financial discipline feedback and pressing family financial obligations, as well as concerning future bankruptcy trends. These quantitative measures, combined with qualitative family data, informed the final composite risk score and the recommendation for conditional credit rather than outright approval.\",\n",

    "  \"response_to_input_task\": \"Executive Summary:\\nThe applicant displays strong credit behavior and income consistency; however, savings-to-expense ratio is slightly below an ideal target and the current employment stability is weak. Family obligations further add pressure on disposable income. The composite risk score, calculated at approximately 75 (on a 0-100 scale), places the applicant in a moderate risk category. Consequently, the recommendation is to offer conditional credit with additional risk-based terms (for example, adjusted interest or collateral requirements) to mitigate the employment instability and family financial obligations.\\n\\nDetailed Calculations and Analysis:\\n1. Average Savings-to-Expense Ratio:\\n   - Data from Dataset 1 (Recurring Expenses) and Dataset 3 (Savings Deposits):\\n     • April 2023: 1500/3200 ≈ 46.9%\\n     • May 2023: 1600/3300 ≈ 48.5%\\n     • June 2023: 1700/3250 ≈ 52.3%\\n     • July 2023: 1800/3400 ≈ 52.9%\\n     • August 2023: 1900/3300 ≈ 57.6%\\n     • September 2023: 2000/3350 ≈ 59.7%\\n   - Average Ratio ≈ (46.9 + 48.5 + 52.3 + 52.9 + 57.6 + 59.7) / 6 ≈ 53.5%\\n   - Scoring: Rule specifies that >50% corresponds to a 'high' score range (70-100). An approximate score of 80 is assigned given the average is in the higher tier but still short of the ideal target of 66%.\\n\\n2. Employment Stability (Dataset 2):\\n   - Tenures: 4.0 years (AlphaTech), 3.0 years (Beta Innovations), and a current period of 1.8+ years (Gamma Financials).\\n   - Since the current employment is under 3 years, stability is classified as low (<50). An approximate score of 45 is assigned.\\n\\n3. Credit Behavior:\\n   - Loan repayment history (Dataset 5) shows all on-time payments and no defaults. Likewise, credit card payment behavior (Dataset 6) is consistently on time.\\n   - Thus, a 'high' rating is warranted with an assigned score of around 95.\\n\\n4. Income Consistency (Dataset 1):\\n   - Monthly income has been stable with a positive trend from $6,500 to $7,000 over the past six months.\\n   - Given regularity and stability, a score of 95 is assigned.\\n\\n5. Financial Discipline and Customer Engagement:\\n   - Analysis of detailed spending (Dataset 4) shows moderate discretionary spending and no erratic behavior. Customer engagement (Dataset 7) indicates a generally positive sentiment despite minor concerns.\\n   - Scores of 75 for financial discipline and 80 for engagement are assigned.\\n\\n6. Adjustment for Family Details (Dataset 8):\\n   - While the applicant is married with a spouse contributing $4,000/month, the presence of two dependents and additional household expenditures (schooling and healthcare) slightly reduce disposable income.\\n   - This factor is used as a downward adjustment of approximately 5 points on the overall composite risk score.\\n\\nComposite Risk Score Calculation:\\n   - Savings Behavior (25% weight): 80 * 0.25 = 20.0\\n   - Credit Behavior (25% weight): 95 * 0.25 = 23.75\\n   - Employment Stability (15% weight): 45 * 0.15 = 6.75\\n   - Income Consistency (15% weight): 95 * 0.15 = 14.25\\n   - Financial Discipline (10% weight): 75 * 0.10 = 7.5\\n   - Engagement and Feedback (10% weight): 80 * 0.10 = 8.0\\n   - Sum = 20 + 23.75 + 6.75 + 14.25 + 7.5 + 8.0 = 80.25\\n   - Adjusting for family obligations yields: 80.25 - 5 ≈ 75.25\\n\\nFinal Recommendations:\\n   - Composite Risk Score: ~75/100\\n   - Given a moderate composite score, the risk level is neither excellent nor poor. However, the low employment stability and family financial commitments elevate concern. Therefore, the recommendation is to offer conditional credit with additional terms (e.g., slightly higher interest rates, requirements for additional collateral or tighter monitoring) rather than a full conventional credit approval.\\n   - The bankruptcy data (get_bankruptcy_data) confirms no recent bankruptcy filings, which supports the strong credit behavior but does not mitigate employment stability concerns.\\n\\nFinal Decision: Conditional Credit with Additional Terms\",\n",
    "  \"justification\": \"The comprehensive evaluation integrated multiple dimensions of risk as prescribed by the advanced composite risk score matrix. Each component was scored based on dataset evidence, with adjustments made for family financial obligations. Employment stability was the most significant negative factor, while strong credit behavior and income consistency were positives. The final composite risk score of approximately 75 supports the recommendation for conditional credit, balancing the potential risks with the applicant's demonstrable financial strengths.\",\n",

      "The applicant displays significant risk indicators in the composite risk analysis. Although the monthly income is consistent, the applicant presents a very low savings-to-expense ratio (approximately 3.4%), unstable employment (current role under 3 years), and poor credit behavior as evidenced by repeated missed on-time payments. The spending behavior shows discretionary and gambling-related transactions, and customer engagement feedback is negative. Moreover, family responsibilities with three dependents introduce additional financial stress, and recent bankruptcy trends in upcoming years add further concern. \n",
      "\n",
      "Detailed Analysis and Calculations:\n",
      "1. Savings-to-Expense Ratio Calculation:\n",
      "   - Total Savings Deposits over 6 months: $200 + $150 + $100 + $50 + $100 + $150 = $750\n",
      "   - Average Savings Deposits: $750 / 6 = $125\n",
      "   - Total Recurring Expenses over 6 months: $3,500 + $3,600 + $3,700 + $3,800 + $3,750 + $3,850 = $22,200\n",
      "   - Average Recurring Expenses: $22,200 / 6 ≈ $3,700\n",
      "   - Savings-to-Expense Ratio: 125 / 3700 ≈ 3.4%\n",
      "   - According to the scoring rules, a ratio below 30% results in a low score; thus, a score of approximately 40 is applied for Savings Behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Employment Stability:\n",
      "   - The applicant’s current tenure as a Freelance Consultant is 2.3 years (<3 years threshold), which results in a low score. A score of 45 is assigned for Employment Stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Credit Behavior:\n",
      "   - Loan Repayment History (Dataset 5) shows that all payments were not on time and have resulted in defaults.\n",
      "   - Credit Card Payment Data (Dataset 6) indicates all months as 'No' for on-time payments.\n",
      "   - Consequently, a low score of around 40 is given for Credit Behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Income Consistency:\n",
      "   - Dataset 1 shows stable monthly income around $3200 with minimal variation. This consistency merits a high score; a score of 90 is assigned.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Financial Discipline and Customer Engagement:\n",
      "   - Financial Discipline is moderate due to discretionary spending and gambling-related expenses observed in Dataset 4, resulting in a score of 50.\n",
      "   - Customer Engagement is low, based on negative feedback in Dataset 7, which justifies a score of 40.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Family Details Impact:\n",
      "   - The additional financial burdens reflected by three dependents and high monthly expenditures for schooling and healthcare (Dataset 8) further increase the overall risk, warranting a downward adjustment of the final composite score.\n",

      "Based on the composite risk score of approximately 45, the applicant falls into a high-risk category. Therefore, it is recommended that the applicant be offered conditional credit with additional terms. Such terms should include stricter monitoring, possible collateral requirements, and perhaps a review period to ensure improved financial discipline and stability. This approach balances the opportunity for credit access while mitigating potential risks due to financial instability and future adverse indicators.\",\n",
      "  \"justification\": \"Every component of the analysis was derived by examining the relevant datasets provided. The very low savings-to-expense ratio, unstable employment, and poor credit behavior critically lowered the scores in those categories. While income consistency was a redeeming factor, it was offset by negative financial discipline feedback and pressing family financial obligations, as well as concerning future bankruptcy trends. These quantitative measures, combined with qualitative family data, informed the final composite risk score and the recommendation for conditional credit rather than outright approval.\",\n",

      "The applicant displays strong credit behavior and income consistency; however, savings-to-expense ratio is slightly below an ideal target and the current employment stability is weak. Family obligations further add pressure on disposable income. The composite risk score, calculated at approximately 75 (on a 0-100 scale), places the applicant in a moderate risk category. Consequently, the recommendation is to offer conditional credit with additional risk-based terms (for example, adjusted interest or collateral requirements) to mitigate the employment instability and family financial obligations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Detailed Calculations and Analysis:\n",
      "1. Average Savings-to-Expense Ratio:\n",
      "   - Data from Dataset 1 (Recurring Expenses) and Dataset 3 (Savings Deposits):\n",
      "     • April 2023: 1500/3200 ≈ 46.9%\n",
      "     • May 2023: 1600/3300 ≈ 48.5%\n",
      "     • June 2023: 1700/3250 ≈ 52.3%\n",
      "     • July 2023: 1800/3400 ≈ 52.9%\n",
      "     • August 2023: 1900/3300 ≈ 57.6%\n",
      "     • September 2023: 2000/3350 ≈ 59.7%\n",
      "   - Average Ratio ≈ (46.9 + 48.5 + 52.3 + 52.9 + 57.6 + 59.7) / 6 ≈ 53.5%\n",
      "   - Scoring: Rule specifies that >50% corresponds to a 'high' score range (70-100). An approximate score of 80 is assigned given the average is in the higher tier but still short of the ideal target of 66%.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Employment Stability (Dataset 2):\n",
      "   - Tenures: 4.0 years (AlphaTech), 3.0 years (Beta Innovations), and a current period of 1.8+ years (Gamma Financials).\n",
      "   - Since the current employment is under 3 years, stability is classified as low (<50). An approximate score of 45 is assigned.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Credit Behavior:\n",
      "   - Loan repayment history (Dataset 5) shows all on-time payments and no defaults. Likewise, credit card payment behavior (Dataset 6) is consistently on time.\n",
      "   - Thus, a 'high' rating is warranted with an assigned score of around 95.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Income Consistency (Dataset 1):\n",
      "   - Monthly income has been stable with a positive trend from $6,500 to $7,000 over the past six months.\n",
      "   - Given regularity and stability, a score of 95 is assigned.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Financial Discipline and Customer Engagement:\n",
      "   - Analysis of detailed spending (Dataset 4) shows moderate discretionary spending and no erratic behavior. Customer engagement (Dataset 7) indicates a generally positive sentiment despite minor concerns.\n",
      "   - Scores of 75 for financial discipline and 80 for engagement are assigned.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Adjustment for Family Details (Dataset 8):\n",
      "   - While the applicant is married with a spouse contributing $4,000/month, the presence of two dependents and additional household expenditures (schooling and healthcare) slightly reduce disposable income.\n",
      "   - This factor is used as a downward adjustment of approximately 5 points on the overall composite risk score.\n",
      "\n",
      "Composite Risk Score Calculation:\n",
      "   - Savings Behavior (25% weight): 80 * 0.25 = 20.0\n",
      "   - Credit Behavior (25% weight): 95 * 0.25 = 23.75\n",
      "   - Employment Stability (15% weight): 45 * 0.15 = 6.75\n",
      "   - Income Consistency (15% weight): 95 * 0.15 = 14.25\n",
      "   - Financial Discipline (10% weight): 75 * 0.10 = 7.5\n",
      "   - Engagement and Feedback (10% weight): 80 * 0.10 = 8.0\n",
      "   - Sum = 20 + 23.75 + 6.75 + 14.25 + 7.5 + 8.0 = 80.25\n",
      "   - Adjusting for family obligations yields: 80.25 - 5 ≈ 75.25\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Recommendations:\n",
      "   - Composite Risk Score: ~75/100\n",
      "   - Given a moderate composite score, the risk level is neither excellent nor poor. However, the low employment stability and family financial commitments elevate concern. Therefore, the recommendation is to offer conditional credit with additional terms (e.g., slightly higher interest rates, requirements for additional collateral or tighter monitoring) rather than a full conventional credit approval.\n",
      "   - The bankruptcy data (get_bankruptcy_data) confirms no recent bankruptcy filings, which supports the strong credit behavior but does not mitigate employment stability concerns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Decision: Conditional Credit with Additional Terms\",\n",
      "  \"justification\": \"The comprehensive evaluation integrated multiple dimensions of risk as prescribed by the advanced composite risk score matrix. Each component was scored based on dataset evidence, with adjustments made for family financial obligations. Employment stability was the most significant negative factor, while strong credit behavior and income consistency were positives. The final composite risk score of approximately 75 supports the recommendation for conditional credit, balancing the potential risks with the applicant's demonstrable financial strengths.\",\n",
